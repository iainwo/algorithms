# Dijkstra Shortest Path
> _Notes based on [brilliant.org][1]._ <br>

Find shortest path from source node to target node in weighted graph.
By creating tree of shortests paths from source vertex to all other points in graph.
> can be used on directed or undirected graph.<br>
> can NOT have negative weights

DIfferent from `Bellman-Ford` in that it iterates through all vertices.
Different from `Bellman-Ford` in that it relaxes for the next node with the shortest distance
Different from `Bellman-Ford` in that it doesn't relax all edges - just the outEdges of the current greedy vertex!

Sample pseudo code,
```
function Dijkstra(Graph, source):
       dist[source]  := 0                     // Distance from source to source is set to 0
       for each vertex v in Graph:            // Initializations
           if v â‰  source
               dist[v]  := infinity           // Unknown distance function from source to each node set to infinity
           add v to Q                         // All nodes initially in Q

      while Q is not empty:                  // The main loop
          v := vertex in Q with min dist[v]  // In the first run-through, this vertex is the source node
          remove v from Q 

          for each neighbor u of v:           // where neighbor u has not yet been removed from Q.
              alt := dist[v] + length(v, u)
              if alt < dist[u]:               // A shorter path to u has been found
                  dist[u]  := alt            // Update distance of u 

      return dist[]
  end function
```
