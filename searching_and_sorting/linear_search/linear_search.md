# LINEAR SEARCH

## Problem
Find an element `x`, in an array `arr[]` of `n` elements.

## Conceptual Solution
- Iterate left-to-right over the array
- If `x` matches an element, return index
- If `x` doesn't match, return `-1` index

## Asymptotic Analysis
Is O(n) - because the timecomplexity increases/decreases by a constant amount in proportion to the input.

## Comments
Usually this search algo is not used. Many other are asymptotically superior.
